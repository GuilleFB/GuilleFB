- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GuilleFB

I have a PhD in Marine Ecology from the UIB through an FPI-INIA grant within the PHENOFISH Project. 
Master in Fisheries Resources Management and Aquaculture.
Degree in Marine Sciences.

Although my career has been in the natural sciences, my interests have always been focused on the application of computer science, programming and statistical analysis of data obtained in my research.

My statistical and computer skills have helped me to develop and enhance my professional career.

I have training and experience in programming languages such as R and Python, as well as SQL for databases. I would define myself as a proactive and self-taught person as I have gained my knowledge in programming through my interest and curiosity.

I am interested in finding new challenges outside the natural sciences where I can contribute my knowledge as a data analyst or data scientist.
