ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GuilleFB

I hold a PhD in Marine Ecology from UIB, awarded through an FPI-INIA grant within the PHENOFISH Project, along with a Masterâ€™s in Fisheries Resources Management and Aquaculture and a degree in Marine Sciences.

While my academic background is rooted in the natural sciences, I have always been drawn to the intersection of computer science, programming, and statistical data analysis derived from my research. 

I am currently working as a backend developer at a web development company, where I leverage my skills in **Django, Docker, PostgreSQL, and JavaScript** to build robust and efficient applications. My training and experience in programming languages such as R and Python, as well as SQL for database management, have significantly enhanced my professional journey.

I pride myself on being proactive and self-taught, constantly seeking knowledge through curiosity and hands-on experience. I am eager to take on new challenges beyond the natural sciences, where I can contribute my expertise as a data analyst or data scientist.
